    <h1>ðŸ‘‹ I'm Seth Drebitko</h1>
    <p>I'm making music with Bitwig, and talking about the obstacles of balancing our passions with our health, parenting, and day jobs.</p>
    <p>I share my work and process on <a href="https://youtube.com/c/sethdrebitko">YouTube</a>, as well as behind the scenes updates to patrons.</p>
    <p><em>This site is a work in progress as I am studying front end development for my dayjob.</em></p>
